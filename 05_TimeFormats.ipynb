    "### Technical Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because the format depends on the current locale, care should be taken when making assumptions about the output value. Field orderings will vary (for example, “month/day/year” versus “day/month/year”), and the output may contain Unicode characters encoded using the locale’s default encoding (for example, if the current locale is `ja_JP`, the default encoding could be any one of `eucJP`, `SJIS`, or `utf-8`; use [`locale.getlocale()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getlocale) to determine the current locale’s encoding).\n",
    "2. The `strptime()` method can parse years in the full [`1`, `9999`] range, but years < `1000` must be zero-filled to 4-digit width.\n",
    "3. When used with the `strptime()` method, the `%p` directive only affects the output hour field if the `%I` directive is used to parse the hour.\n",
    "4. Unlike the [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time) module, the [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime) module does not support leap seconds.\n",
    "5. When used with the `strptime()` method, the `%f` directive accepts from one to six digits and zero pads on the right. `%f` is an extension to the set of format characters in the C standard (but implemented separately in datetime objects, and therefore always available).\n",
    "6. For a naive object, the `%z` and `%Z` format codes are replaced by empty strings.<br/>\n",
    "For an aware object:\n",

    "--- | ---\n",
    "`%z` | `utcoffset()` is transformed into a string of the form `±HHMM[SS[.ffffff]]`, where `HH` is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset hours, `MM` is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset minutes, `SS` is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset seconds and `ffffff` is a 6-digit string giving the number of UTC offset microseconds. The `ffffff` part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of seconds and both the `ffffff` and the `SS` part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of minutes. For example, if `utcoffset()` returns `timedelta(hours=-3, minutes=-30)`, `%z` is replaced with the string `'-0330'`.\n",
    "`%Z` | In strftime(), `%Z` is replaced by an empty string if `tzname()` returns `None`; otherwise `%Z` is replaced by the returned value, which must be a string.<br/>`strptime()` only accepts certain values for `%Z`:<br/>1. any value in `time.tzname` for your machine’s locale<br/>2. the hard-coded values `UTC` and `GMT`<br/>So someone living in Japan may have `JST`, `UTC`, and `GMT` as valid values, but probably not `EST`. It will raise [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) for invalid values.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. When used with the `strptime()` method, `%U` and `%W` are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the calendar year (`%Y`) are specified.\n",
    "8. Similar to `%U` and `%W`, `%V` is only used in calculations when the day of the week and the ISO year (`%G`) are specified in a `strptime()` format string. Also note that `%G` and `%Y` are not interchangeable.\n",
    "9. When used with the `strptime()` method, the leading zero is optional for formats `%d`, `%m`, `%H`, `%I`, `%M`, `%S`, `%J`, `%U`, `%W`, and `%V`. Format `%y` does require a leading zero."
