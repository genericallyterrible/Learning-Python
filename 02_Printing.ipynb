Then, if `m <= exp < p`, where `m` is -4 for floats and -6 for `Decimals`, the number is formatted with presentation type `'f'` and precision `p-1-exp`.

In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it, unless the `'#'` option is used.<br/><br/>With no precision given, uses a precision of `6` significant digits for `float`. For `Decimal`, the coefficient of the result is formed from the coefficient digits of the value; scientific notation is used for values smaller than `1e-6` in absolute value and values where the place value of the least significant digit is larger than 1, and fixed-point notation is used otherwise.<br/><br/>Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as `inf`, `-inf`, `0`, `-0`, and `nan` respectively, regardless of the precision.\n",

    "`'n'` | Number. This is the same as `'g'`, except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters.\n",
    "`'%'` | Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed (`'f'`) format, followed by a percent sign.\n",
    "None | For float this is the same as `'g'`, except that when fixed-point notation is used to format the result, it always includes at least one digit past the decimal point. The precision used is as large as needed to represent the given value faithfully.<br/><br/>For `Decimal`, this is the same as either `'g'` or `'G'` depending on the value of `context.capitals` for the current decimal context.<br/><br/>The overall effect is to match the output of `str()` as altered by the other format modifiers."
